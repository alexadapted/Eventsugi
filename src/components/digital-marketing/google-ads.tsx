    question: 'Which type Google Ads is most effective?',
    answer:
      'Search ads are the most effective type of Google Ads. They appear on the search engine results page (SERP) when users search for specific keywords. These ads are highly targeted and relevant to the userâ€™s search intent, making them more likely to convert. Search ads are also cost-effective, as you only pay when a user clicks on your ad.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the 3 levels of Google Ads?',
    answer:
      'The three levels of Google Ads are campaign, ad group, and ad. A campaign is a set of ad groups that share a budget, location targeting, and other settings. An ad group contains one or more ads that target a shared set of keywords. An ad is a combination of a headline, description, and URL that promotes your business. '
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do Google Ads take to work?',
    answer:
      'Google Ads can take anywhere from a few hours to a few months to work. The time it takes for your ads to work depends on several factors, including your budget, competition, and ad quality. It can take a few hours for your ads to start running, but it can take a few months to see results. '
  },
  {
    question: 'How much should a beginner budget for Google Ads?',
    answer:
      'Beginners should budget at least $5 per day for Google Ads. This budget is enough to run a few ads and test the platform. However, it is not enough to run a successful campaign. To run a successful campaign, you should budget at least $10 per day. '
